          It’s completely free, so don’t worry! We'll provide you with a
          weekend's worth of meals, drinks, and snacks and a place to crash when
          you need a break from coding. In fact, you’ll probably walk away
          loaded with all the swag that you’ll get at Hack the Valley.

          Hack The Valley almost entirely by (sleep-deprived) University of
          Toronto students, with some advice and assistance from our friends at
          Department of Student Life (DSL) and Association of Mathematical and
          Computer Science Students (AMACSS). One hundred percent of the funding
          for Hack the Valley comes from corporate sponsor donations.
