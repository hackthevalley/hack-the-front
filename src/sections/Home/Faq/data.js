        It’s completely free, so don’t worry! We'll provide you with a weekend's
        worth of meals, drinks, and snacks and a place to crash when you need a
        break from coding. In fact, you’ll probably walk away loaded with all
        the swag that you’ll get at Hack the Valley.

        Hack The Valley almost entirely by (sleep-deprived) University of
        Toronto students, with some advice and assistance from our friends at
        Department of Student Life (DSL) and Association of Mathematical and
        Computer Science Students (AMACSS). One hundred percent of the funding
        for Hack the Valley comes from corporate sponsor donations.
